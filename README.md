# AI Project

## Working

The "Disease Classification between Corona and Pneumonia using Machine Learning Algorithm" project aims to develop a system that can accurately classify chest X-ray images into one of two categories: COVID-19 (caused by the novel coronavirus) or pneumonia. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms, specifically deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze and classify the X-ray images based on the presence of specific patterns or features indicative of the respective diseases. The project requires a large dataset of chest X-ray images labeled with their corresponding disease type to train and evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning model. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient tool for medical professionals to quickly diagnose patients with COVID-19 or pneumonia, ultimately improving patient outcomes and saving lives.
